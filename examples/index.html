			<h1>What does Datalier <em>do?</em></h1>
			<p>Here's some data. Let's say each point represents a time and the number of fries I ate at that time.</p>
			<div id="example1" class="flotGraph"></div>
			<div id="graphContainer"></div>
			<div id="controller"><a class="button" id="previousExample">Previous Example</a><a class="button" id="randomizeData">Randomize Y-value Data</a><a class="button" id="nextExample">Next Example</a></div>
		</div>
		<div id="graph1" class="graph">
			<p>Let's count the number of points or <em>events</em> so far, and map that to the "time" value.</p>
			<p>A simple way to describe this is: Let's count how many events have occurred since the beginning. e.g. This graph shows the number of times I ate fries since the beginning of time.</p>
			<p>This is <span class="code">accumulateCount</span> since the y-value accumulates, and it counts the number of events.</p>
			<div id="example4" class="flotGraph"></div>
			<p>The filter for this looks like:</p>
			<pre class="code" id="filter4"></pre>
		</div>
		<div id="graph2" class="graph">
			<p>Now, let's do the same thing, but <em>sum</em> the values of the points from our data. Both of these graph types are useful for comparing current data to previous data.</p>
			<p>A simple way to describe this is: Let's count how much of something has occurred since the beginning. e.g. This graph shows the total number of fries I ate since the beginning of time.</p>
			<p>This is <span class="code">accumulateField</span> since the y-value accumulates, and it sums the values of the given field.</p>
			<div id="example5" class="flotGraph"></div>
			<p>The filter for this looks like:</p>
			<pre class="code" id="filter5"></pre>
		</div>
		<div id="graph3" class="graph">
			<p>Let's look at a common use case: compacting frequent data points down into granular time periods. This is useful for viewing the rate of activity, or event occurrences.</p>
			<p>A simple way to describe this is: Let's count how many times something is happening per unit of time. e.g. This graph shows the number of times I ate fries during each 2 hour period.</p>
			<p>This is <span class="code">collapseCount</span> and it counts the number of events that occur every <span class="code">granularity</span> period of time.</p>
			<div id="example2" class="flotGraph"></div>
			<p>The filter for this looks like:</p>
			<pre class="code" id="filter2"></pre>
		</div>
		<div id="graph4" class="graph">
			<p>Finally, instead of counting the number of events that occur every period of time, let's sum the values of a field in those events. This is useful for viewing something like data usage.</p>
			<p>A simple way to describe this is: Let's count how much of something has occurred per unit of time. e.g. This graph shows the total number of fries I ate during each 2 hour period.</p>
			<p>This is <span class="code">collapseField</span> and it sums the value of a field in events that occur every <span class="code">granularity</span> period of time.</p>
			<div id="example3" class="flotGraph"></div>
			<p>The filter for this looks like:</p>
			<pre class="code" id="filter3"></pre>
		</div>
		<div id="graph5" class="graph">
